App's basic logic


Each member starts with 100 credits.

On the main page, every Tuesday, 10 matches to be played that week are listed

Members choose at least 2 of these matches and play from 10 different categories of betting options, with at least 2 categories per match.

Each betting category (under 3 goals, over 3 goals, first goal's minute etc.) will have a cost (e.g. 1 credit for betting under)

There won't be categories like who will win because we don't want to identify the favorite teams in the first place. (later we can do this with ai maybe)

Each category will also have a factor and the credit invested will be multiplied by this factor and this point will be added to the member if it is won or deducted from the member if it is lost
